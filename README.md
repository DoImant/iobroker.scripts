## What can be found here?

In this repository are scripts that I use in ioBroker. At the moment the script collection is limited to the processing of data received from my SensEgg sensors ([See what SensEgg is](https://www.arduinoforum.de/arduino-Thread-SensEgg-light-FunkSensor-ATtiny814-nRF24-BME280-NTC)) and a Mobile Alerts rain gauge (MA 10650).

Data retrieval of the rain gauge is done via the [Mobile Alerts REST API](https://mobile-alerts.eu/info/public_server_api_documentation.pdf).

The code for the SensEgg sensor and the serial gateway to ioBroker can be found here:
